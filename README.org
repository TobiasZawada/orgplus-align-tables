#+TITLE: Align tables with formulae in Orgmode
#+AUTHOR: Tobias Zawada

* Introduction


Formulae with LaTeX preview can mess up the alignment of Org tables.
An example is the the following table:

| Name                              | Formula            | Domain   |
|-----------------------------------+--------------------+----------|
| Einstein's resting energy formula | $E = m\cdot c^2$   | Physics  |
| Pythagoras                        | $z=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ | Geometry |

With vanilla Org 9.3 it is rendered as shown in the following picture:

The columns behind the formulae are not correctly aligned.

This is corrected by this package.
With ~org+-align-table-mode~ enabled, the columns are aligned:

Note, that this package is in an experimental state.
Please, try it and maybe, leave a note if something goes wrong.
* Installation

Just put ~org+-align-table.el~ somewhere in your ~load-path~ and add the following to your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :export source :eval never
(with-eval-after-load 'org-mode
  (require org+-align-table.el))
#+END_SRC

* Usage
The usage is very simple. ~org+-align-table-mode~ is enabled in Org mode buffers opened after the installation of this package.

You can toggle it by typing ~M-x org+-align-table-mode~.
